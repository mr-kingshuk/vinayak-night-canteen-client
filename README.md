## Problems Faced in College

So, last year in 2023, access to food at late night was limited due to the fact that after **10:45 PM (our hostel in-time)**, hot food was only available via phone orders to the Vinayak Store, which often led to a few problems:

1. <ins>**Inefficient Communication**</ins> between the Vinayak Store and customers led to <ins>**late deliveries**</ins>, missed orders due to <ins>**unreceived calls**</ins>, and <ins>**incorrect orders**</ins> due to confusion between orders, causing significant frustration among users.

2. Lack of motivation among late-night workers led to delays in food preparation, and declining Quality of Service (QoS), resulting in repeated student complaints and a cycle of dissatisfaction that further demotivated workers.

3.  The <ins>**Store Owner of Canteen**</ins> felt that the store's reputation was being tarnished due to service inefficiencies, despite having sufficient stock, which led to complaints within the college.

This was all due to <ins>**Lack of Central Monitoring**</ins>, which left students uninformed about order status and inventory levels, leading to confusion and misconceptions. The store ownerâ€™s lack of visibility into orders and stock sometimes resulted in workers lying about item availability to reduce their workload.

Addressing these issues is crucial for improving the operational environment for the **Vinayak Store** and Night Canteen as a whole.

## Solution Provided by This Software
To address these challenges, I developed a comprehensive Night Canteen Website for Vinayak Canteen. The platform features a 3-tier user role system, including **`User`**, **`Worker`**, and **`Merchant`** profiles. Key functionalities include:

- <ins>**Integrated Razorpay**</ins> for secure payments, ensuring a smooth transaction process, ensuring pre-payment of orders, to allow order confirmation, from both Store as well as Student side
- <ins>**Cron jobs**</ins> to manage item availability based on store timings, automatically toggling items off when the store closes and on when it opens, managed by the store owner.
- <ins>**Manual control of items**</ins> through the Worker interface, allowing for dynamic menu management, which is visible to the Store Owner as well. 
- <ins>**Central State Management**</ins> to efficiently handle the state of User Details and Order Details, enabling users to add items to the cart from both the Menu HomePage and the Order Summary Page.
- <ins>**Use of localStorage**</ins> to persist User and Order Details, allowing for easy access when the User returns to the website later.
- A robust <ins>**CMS portal**</ins> for Merchants to manage menu items and store timings, along with a <ins>**CRM portal**</ins> to track all orders, including cancelled and delivered orders.
- <ins>**Responsive Design**</ins> for all three user roles, ensuring a seamless experience across devices, whether on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

This project highlights advanced web development skills with a focus on real-time communication, payment integration, and efficient store management.

## Central State Management

Central State Management in this project is implemented using React's `Context API` and the `useReducer` hook, providing a way to efficiently manage and share state across components. This documentation covers two main contexts used for state management: <ins>**AuthContext**</ins> and <ins>**OrderContext**</ins>.

<ins>1. AuthContext</ins>

The **AuthContext** manages user authentication state, including login, signup, logout, and updates to user details.

| **Action** | **Description**                                                |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LOGIN**  | Updates the state with the authenticated user's information.  |
| **SIGNUP** | Registers a new user and updates the state.                   |
| **LOGOUT** | Resets the user and user details to `null`.                   |
| **UPDATE** | Updates the user's details while preserving their identity.    |

- **Reducer and Provider**: The `authReducer` handles state transitions based on dispatched actions, while the **AuthContextProvider** wraps the application to provide authentication state and dispatch function to its children. It initializes the state from `localStorage` to maintain the user's authentication status across sessions.

<ins>2. OrderContext</ins>

The **OrderContext** manages the state of order items, allowing components to modify orders.

| **Action**       | **Description**                                                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ADD**          | Initializes the order with a given array of items.                     |
| **INCREMENT**    | Increases the quantity of a specific item.                              |
| **DECREMENT**    | Decreases the quantity, removing the item if it reaches zero.           |
| **REMOVE**       | Clears all items from the order.                                       |
| **REMOVE_SINGLE**| Removes a specific item from the order.                                 |

- **Reducer and Provider**: The `orderReducer` handles state changes based on dispatched actions, ensuring the order state updates correctly. The **OrderContextProvider** wraps the application to provide order state and dispatch function to its children, utilizing `localStorage` to persist the order state across sessions.

## Custom Auth Hooks

This project includes three custom hooks that utilize the **AuthContext** to manage user authentication: **useLogin**, **useLogout**, and **useSignup**. Each hook provides specific functionalities to streamline authentication processes in the application.

### 1. **useLogin**

The **useLogin** hook handles the user login process. The **login(email, password)** function, which the hook returns sends a POST request to the login API endpoint. If the login is successful, it updates the local storage with the user's information and dispatches the login action to the AuthContext. This hook also returns `error` which contains value of any error encountered during the login attempt and `isLoading` which indicates whether the login process is ongoing.

### 2. **useSignup**

The **useSignup** hook manages user registration. The **signup(email, password, reEnterPassword, name)** function, which the hook returns, sends a POST request to the signup API endpoint. Upon successful registration, it saves the user information to local storage and dispatches the signup action to the AuthContext. This hook also returns `error` which contains value of any error encountered during the signup attempt and `isLoading` which indicates whether the signup process is ongoing.

### 3. **useLogout**

The **useLogout** hook manages user logout. The function **logout()**, which is returned from this hook removes user information and order data from local storage. It dispatches a logout action to the AuthContext and a remove action to the OrderContext.
